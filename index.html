                <p>Singapore, a city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, lies approximately 85
                    miles
                    (137 kilometers) north of the Equator. It consists of Singapore Island and around 60 small islets.
                    Known
                    for its strategic position, Singapore is the largest port in Southeast Asia and one of the busiest
                    in
                    the world. Its prosperity is attributed to its dominance over the Strait of Malacca, which connects
                    the
                    Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. Once a British colony, Singapore gained independence on August
                    9,
                    1965, and has since become a global city with a thriving economy, efficient governance, and vibrant
                    trade and tourism </p>

                <p>The Republic of Singapore, an island nation, lies just one degree north of the Equator in Southern
                    Asia.
                    Its territory includes the main Singapore Island and approximately 58 smaller islands. Thanks to its
                    determined government, Singapore has flourished as a model for developing nations. It excels in
                    trade,
                    tourism, and efficiency, making it a remarkable success story in the region.</p>
